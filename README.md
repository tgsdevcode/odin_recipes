This is the first odin project.

For future memory, the steps followed were:

Create a github repository (in firefox)
copy the link to the repository
in the projects folder execute: git clone link
cd repository folder
setup this file with nano README.md

after coding do:
git add . (. - add all files)
git commit .
git push origin main
